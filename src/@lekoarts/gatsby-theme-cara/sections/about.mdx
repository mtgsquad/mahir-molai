# About
I'm a 13 year old, who was first interested in how iOS apps are made, Then I wanted to know what was behind websites, and desktop apps. So I started coding myself, then ended up as javascript developer. I still try to work as hard as possible. My dream is to get a job at google as a javascript developer, or software engineer, I'll aim for a javascript related job, since most software engineer interviews have algorithm questions. But we'll see that when I'm 18 and ready to start working.
