This is my own discord bot, which is publicly available, it will make moderating your discord server a lot easier for you, I plan to add music functionality to it soon.

<ProjectCard title="MTGSquad's CDN" link="https://cdn.mtgsquad-dev.com/" bg="linear-gradient(to right, #ff416c, #ff4b2b);">
MTGSquad's CDN is a content delivery network which you can use to host images, css files, and javascript files. This is super-fast and useful, I myself use the CDN all the time, look at the guide on the repository here: <a href="https://github.com/mtgsquad/cdn-content#-mtgsquads-cdn">Add Your Own Content Guide</a>
